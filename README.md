# tactical-mobility-suit
I've had a number of ideas of designing a wearable suit system that can provide environmental protection/isolation for the operator (temperature control, air pressure, vapor barrier/drainage, etc), as well as ways to augment and assist in mobility. For example, an operator could perform search and rescue during disasters more effectively, being able to more quickly traverse unstable terrain, travel faster and further while carrying large loads (supplies, passengers, etc), than a person could without the suit.

This sounds like the "iron man" suit from comic books, but the scope is limited to be realistic to build a prototype with existing technology. I imagine there would be a skin tight "dry suit", with integrated cooling and drainage tubing, combined with mobility mechanisms powered by the operators own locomotion, to optimize for speed, distance, and weight capacity for various terrain scenarios (water, flat land, steep hills/mountains, limited spaces like caves or buildings, etc). For cooling, I imagine using a small reservoir of liquid nitrogen, with an electrical pump and circuit to manage the operator's temperature. There's still lots of work to be done for the design, especially how to augment normal locomotion into specialized mobility.
